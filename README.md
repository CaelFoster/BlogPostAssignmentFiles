# Blog Post Project #4

I've included many of the points I wanted to address inside of the ReadMe blog when you enter 
the site.

## Things to consider

This site wont be hosted by netlify or vercel, but rather our own server,
main reason being that this site is already hosted in a convenient and dynamic way
and I don't have an ssh key on my local device to set up the database to do so. 

I did build this from scratch with a basic wordpress template, the only things 
that were custom configured were caddy and docker files for an easy live editing 
experience. 

The fave icon is also handled by wordpress so i wont be including a folder containing 
a bunch of icons, just the one that the site uses.

I did on the otherhand include images of the backend structure, just enough for you to
get a idea of how the blog post directly interacts with what you see in the page content
in hopes of saving you time when looking at the project.
