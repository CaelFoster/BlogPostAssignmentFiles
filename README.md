# Blog Post Project #4

I've included many of the points I wanted to address inside of the ReadMe blog when you enter 
the site.

## Things to consider

This site won't be hosted by Netlify or Vercel, but rather by our own server,
the main reason is that this site is already hosted in a convenient and dynamic way
and I don't have an SSH key on my local device to set up the database to do so. 

I did build this from scratch with a basic WordPress template, the only things 
that were custom configured were caddy and docker files for easy live editing 
experience. 

The fave icon is also handled by WordPress so I won't be including a folder containing 
a bunch of icons, just the one that the site uses.

I did on the other hand include images of the backend structure, just enough for you to
get an idea of how the blog post directly interacts with what you see in the page content
in hopes of saving you time when looking at the project. 

Feel free to download the files or just dig through them in GitHub directly, 
you will need an editor to view the twig files, I'm unsure if that also applies
for the scss.
